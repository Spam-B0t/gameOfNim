Simulation of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim  
Currently supports multiplayer mode(human, AI with 3 levels of difficulty) and  
multiple heap game.

TO DO:  
- Extend AI, so it could play with more than 2 heaps.  
- Add tests for user input.  
- Modify field structure, so it would contain non-empty heap counter.  
- Swap all use of nonEmptyHeaps function with aforementioned counter.
